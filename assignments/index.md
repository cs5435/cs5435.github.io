## Assignments

Assignments are available on Canvas.  Please use Git to work on your projects.

### Homework Template
You should submit your homework in Canvas as a PDF along with any code files required by the assignments.  
We encourage using the provided [LATEX template]({{site.url}}/assignments/template/main.tex) for short answer questions.
