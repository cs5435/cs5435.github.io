## Welcome to CS 5435

This course is a broad overview of modern computer security and digital privacy.  It aims to impart technical and social understanding of how and why security and privacy matter, how to think adversarially, and how (and how not) to design secure systems and products. Topics include authentication, Web and mobile security, network, OS, and low-level software security, elements of applied cryptography, privacy protection technologies, censorship resistance, and security and privacy of emerging platforms, illustrated by studying real-world systems and attacks. Key learning objectives include understanding the role of threat modeling in the design and evaluation of modern computing systems, how exploitation of computing systems works, and approaches to finding and remediating vulnerabilities.
