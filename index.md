## Welcome to CS 5435

Welcome to CS 5435: Security and Privacy Concepts in the Wild at Cornell Tech. This course will impart a technical and social understanding of how and why security and privacy matter, how to think adversarially, how (and how not) to design systems and products. Less attention will be paid to specific skills such as hacking, writing secure code, and security administration. Topics will include user authentication, cryptography, malware, behavioral economics in security, human factors in security, privacy and anonymity, side channels, decoys and deception, and adversarial modeling. We will explore these concepts by studying real-world systems and attacks, including Bitcoin, Stuxnet, retailer breaches, implantable medical devices, and health apps, and considering issues to come in personal genomics, virtual worlds, and autonomous vehicles.
